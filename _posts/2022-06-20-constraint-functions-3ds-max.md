In the past years I started creating my own library of functions and scripts that would automate a lot of the processes that I often use when rigging characters to speed up the rigging process even more.

I have so many rigging functions that one day I realized I could create an entire humanoid rig in a matter of minutes by using all these functions as long as I had a skeleton created.

In time I will be releasing a function library for all of you to check it out, meanwhile, here is a little preview of some of the functions I use often, the Look-At constraint could use more work but the Position Constraint, Orientation Constraint and Path Constraint Functions are perfect for pretty much anything that I would use them for.
