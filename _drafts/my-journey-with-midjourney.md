I have now spent over a month playing with Midjourney during my free time, I have to be honest, I did not know much about it up until the day I got accepted into Beta, and I have been in awe from day one!

This Tech is absolutely game changing, and all for the right reasons! I spent some time in the last two weeks speaking with some of the concept artists here at work and some welcomed this tech and some were "afraid" of it, thinking that it could render junior concept artists obsolete or make their work less valuable. I actually thing the opposite, this tool can be used to help their creativity!

Concept artists can use an AI like this to enable their creativity and help them come up with more varied and creative Ideas, This would like finding just the right reference for your work, but instead of going to google for it, you are creating your own reference imaged based particularly on what  prompts you are looking for.

Now this AI is not perfect and learning how to write a good prompt takes practice, you will need to understanding the "language" of how the AI processes the prompts. You will get some interesting results along the way, but that is not necesserely a bad thing! These "happy accidents", as I like to call them, are simply adding ideas to your imagination as well as teaching you how to better control the AI.
