I have now spent over a month playing with Midjourney during my free time, I have to be honest, I did not know much about it up until the day I got accepted into Beta, and I have been in awe from day one!

This tech is absolutely game changing, and all for the right reasons! I have spoken to some concept artists colleagues of mine and some welcomed this tech and some were concerned with it, thinking that it could render junior concept artists obsolete or make their work less valuable. I actually thing the opposite, this tool can be used to help their creativity and bridge the gap of communication when trying to find what an Art director is asking for.

Concept artists can use an AI like this to enable their creativity and help them come up with more varied and creative Ideas, This would like finding just the right reference for your work, but instead of going to google for it, you are creating your own reference imaged based particularly on what  prompts you are looking for.

Now this AI is not perfect and learning how to write a good prompt takes practice, you will need to understanding the "language" of how the AI processes the prompts. You will get some interesting results along the way, but that is not necessarily a bad thing! These "happy accidents", as I like to call them, are simply adding ideas to your imagination as well as teaching you how to better control the AI.

The process to start creating your imagines through Midjourney is pretty simple, once you are invited by someone or accepted into the Beta, you will be asked to join their discord server where they will point you to one of the newbie channels, there you will start to create anything your mind can come up with by simply typing /imagine - this will automatically add a prompt field to your message and that is where you will type your prompt.

This is one of the prompts I used: fantasy tree, mythical creatures, realistic, rendered in octane, vast landscape, high fantasy, magical, intricate -- aspect 16:9

As you can see you can usee some syntaxing for changeing the spect ratio or the height and or width of the rendered imagines(--h 800 would set the height to 800 pixels), by default the images will render at 1:1
